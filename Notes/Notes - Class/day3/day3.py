#That last one is creating a string.
#Variable I am creating always has to be on the left side, because '=' works as an assignment, but you already knew that.

#Why the fuck, how could it be that easy

#No spaces in variable names, no mathematical symbols, probably no symbols, numbers are allowed as long as they are not the first character. Also duh, no reserved words.

print type(pi)
#Tells us what type of variable the number is when you run it. Useful when math isn't working how it should and you want to see what type of data it is.

#// is the symbol for 'integer division'. Guaruntees  what you get is an integer. Apparently confusing and not very useful.

#But apparently modulo is really useful now! Go figure.

strig="I am so fucking"
strig0=" TIRED"
total=strig+strig0
print total
#Prints the things next to each other.

#If one multiplies the string it will print the text the number of times you multiply it by. Like, strig0*30 will print TIRED 30 times.

#A string is not something that can be interpreted by a computer. A computer can look at a nummber and interpret meaning. With a a string it knows what the characters are but it can't really do anything with or to. 

#OK OK OK something new here now. Keyboard inputs!
