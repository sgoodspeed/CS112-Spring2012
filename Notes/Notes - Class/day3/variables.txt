Variables in Python:

integers: duh

long: for long numbers, not only decimals. Apparently you store them as such:

100,000,000,000,000,000L

But never mind because apparently this is automated in Python I guess.

Float: Decimal, duh

Boolean: True/false variables. So we are actually gonna use them this time?

Strings: Paul says they are pretty much whatever you want, inside quotation marks. He wrote "Whatever" on the board, so there is that.
