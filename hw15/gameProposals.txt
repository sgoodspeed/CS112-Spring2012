Sorry for the late! I totally forgot the deadline wasn't the end of break.

Little metroidvania type game, in a garbage dump you run around and are a 
sentient intelligence that has sprung into existence completely by chance, 
you add little parts to yourself to increase your ability to traverse, the 
point of the game could either be evolution or avoiding humans. (This one is 
probably my preferred of the three, the potential project seems like it would 
be not too difficult to set up an effective and fun control scheme and then 
just expand the world and sequencing.)
Gameplay:
	
	Power acquisition (Maybe some powers increase your brainpower and have non-locomotive benefits?)
	
	Platformy runny (shooty? Punchy?) gameplay
	


Game where you are an animal on some sort of alien-y planet, walking around 
and trying to like, be alive. Survival type game where you sometimes fight 
other animals, but also eat and try to survive. Could get creative with the 
enemy types, maybe halfway through the game could add the mechanics of tool 
use/acquisition, and having a pack to lead, changing it from sort of a run 
and hide game to fight and strategize. I imagine the perspective/interface 
sort of looking like a classic Zelda game, with single screens scrolling and 
a big overworld map


Prototype of a management/strategizing type game; you control a group of 
nanobots whose goal is to break down and assimilate the entire planet. Each 
level is a region or area/setting, you click to control and break down small 
objects to get more bots to make more bots to break down larger objects, and 
eventually specialize to a few different types of bot-puddles, some that 
fight and some that build and some that break down.
